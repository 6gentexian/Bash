#  README
#  ======
#
#
#  This suite of scripts provides user and system settings for bash and profile
#  type files
#
#
#  FILES:
#
#    .profile has the stuff NOT specifically related to bash,
#      such as environment variables (PATH and friends)
#
#    .bashrc has anything you'd want at an interactive command line.
#      Ex. command prompt, EDITOR variable, user-specific bash aliases
#
#    .bash_profile should be super-simple and just load .profile and
#      .bashrc (in that order)
#
#
#
#  DEPENDENCIES: N/A
#
#
#
#
#
#
#  USE:  edit .bashrc: $ cd ~/; emacs .bashrc
#        Rememeber to source the files after saving: $ source .bashrc
#
#  NB: Ensure that ~/.bash_login does not exist.
#      .bashrc must not output anything
#
#      Anything that should be available to graphical applications OR to sh
#        (or bash invoked as sh) MUST be in ~/.profile
#      Anything that should be available only to login shells should go in ~/.profile
